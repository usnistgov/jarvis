JARVIS-Tools: an open-source software package for data-driven atomistic materials design
=========================================================================================


NIST-JARVIS (Joint Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations) is an integrated framework for computational science using density functional theory,
classical force-field/molecular dynamics and machine-learning. The jarvis-tools package consists of scripts used in generating and analyzing the dataset. The NIST-JARVIS official website is: https://jarvis.nist.gov . This project is a part of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) at NIST (https://mgi.nist.gov/).

For more details, checkout our latest article:  `JARVIS: An Integrated Infrastructure for Data-driven Materials Design <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01831>`__

* A summary of the projects

  ===============  =======================================================================
  Projects          Brief description
  ===============  =======================================================================
  ``JARVIS-DFT``      Density functional theory calculation database for ~40000 3D and ~1000 2D materials. Some of the material-properties include: Heat of formation, Crystal-structural data using OptB88vdW, PBE, LDA functionals, Bandgaps using semi-local, meta-GGA, HSE06 and other beyond DFT methods, Electron and phonon-bandstructures, Elastic, Piezoelectric, Thermoelectric, Dielectric tensors, Exfoliation energies for low-diemnsional materials, Frequency dependent dielectric function, Absorption coefficients, Work-function for 2D materials, Infrared and Raman intensities, Electric field gradient, Magnetic moment, Solar-cell efficiencies, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) images, Topological spin-orbit spillage, converged k-point and plane wave cut-offs, Wannier-tight binding Hamiltonian parameters and more. The website for JARVIS-DFT: https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/~knc6/JVASP.html
  ``JARVIS-FF``       Classical molecular dynamics calculation database for ~2000 3D materials with interatomic potential/force-fields. Some of the properties included in JARVIS-FF are energetics, elastic constants, surface energies, defect formations energies and phonon frequencies of materials. The website for JARVIS-FF: https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/~knc6/periodic.html
