  ``JARVIS-DFT``      Density functional theory calculation database for ~40000 3D and ~1000 2D materials. Some of the material-properties include: Heat of formation, Crystal-structural data using OptB88vdW, PBE, LDA functionals, Bandgaps using semi-local, meta-GGA, HSE06 and other beyond DFT methods, Electron and phonon-bandstructures, Elastic, Piezoelectric, Thermoelectric, Dielectric tensors, Exfoliation energies for low-diemnsional materials, Frequency dependent dielectric function, Absorption coefficients, Work-function for 2D materials, Infrared and Raman intensities, Electric field gradient, Magnetic moment, Solar-cell efficiencies, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) images, Topological spin-orbit spillage, converged k-point and plane wave cut-offs, Wannier-tight binding Hamiltonian parameters and more.

  ``JARVIS-FF``       Classical molecular dynamics calculation database for ~2000 3D materials with interatomic potential/force-fields. Some of the properties included in JARVIS-FF are energetics, elastic constants, surface energies, defect formations energies and phonon frequencies of materials. The website for JARVIS-FF: https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/~knc6/periodic.html
  ``JARVIS-ML``       Machine learning prediction tools trained on the JARVIS-DFT data. Some of the ML-prediction models are for  Heat of formation, GGA/METAGGA bandgaps, Refractive indices, Bulk and shear modulus, Magnetic moment, Thermoelectric, Piezoelectric and Dielectric properties properties, Exfoliation energies, Solar-cell efficiency, and STM image classification.
